Title:
Home Automation Device for Voice-Controlled Operation of Non-Smart Devices Using Replaceable Bluetooth/Communication Modules

*Field of Invention:*
This invention relates to the field of home automation and smart home technology. Specifically, it involves the development of a low-cost, 
voice-controlled device that retrofits non-smart appliances and allows users to control them using AI voice assistants such as Google Assistant, 
Alexa, Siri, or Bixby. The device connects appliances via a central microcontroller and sub-devices, using wireless communication modules and relays for automation.

Background of the Invention:
As smart home technology becomes more common, many households are still equipped with non-smart devices that require manual operation. 
Replacing all appliances with smart ones is often expensive and impractical, especially for individuals with physical disabilities or elderly people who face mobility challenges. 
These individuals may struggle with manually operating their household appliances, and a more affordable, voice-controlled solution is needed.

This invention addresses these issues by offering a system that turns non-smart appliances into smart devices at a low cost, 
without requiring users to replace their existing devices. The invention can work with a range of communication technologies, making it versatile and adaptable for future advancements.
