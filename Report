- Description of the Invention:

1. System Overview:
    The home automation system is built around a central microcontroller unit (Node MCU ESP8266 or similar), which communicates with sub-devices connected to individual appliances. 
    The communication between the central unit and sub-devices is established using replaceable wireless technologies like Bluetooth modules, Wi-Fi, or Zigbee. The sub-devices control 
    appliances through relays.


2. Components Used:
    Central Controller (Node MCU ESP8266):
                                        The central controller acts as the main processing unit. It connects to the home's internet network and communicates with AI assistants 
                                        (Google, Alexa, Siri, Bixby) to receive voice commands. It can also be replaced with more advanced microcontroller systems if needed.
    Bluetooth or Communication Module:
                                        This module allows wireless communication between the central microcontroller and the sub-devices. The design accommodates various technologies 
                                        like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Zigbee, allowing the system to adapt to the latest communication protocols.
    Custom Designed PCB Board:
                                        A custom-designed PCB integrates the components, including the microcontroller, Bluetooth module, relays, and connectors. 
                                        The design ensures efficient communication and power management.
    Relays:
                                        Relays are used to control the on/off state of connected appliances. Each sub-device is fitted with a relay that is activated based on signals from the central microcontroller.
    Electronic Components:
                                        The system uses various supporting components such as resistors, diodes, transistors, capacitors, and power management circuits to ensure stable operation.
3. Operation:
    Voice Command Input: 
                                        The user provides a voice command (e.g., "Turn on the lights") via an AI assistant. The voice assistant processes the command and sends a signal to the central microcontroller.

    Signal Transmission: 
                                        The central microcontroller processes the command and sends a corresponding signal to the appropriate sub-device via the communication module (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi).

    Relay Activation: 
                                        The sub-device controlling the target appliance activates its relay, either turning the appliance on or off as requested.

    Feedback Loop: 
                                        The central microcontroller can provide feedback to the AI assistant, confirming that the command was successfully executed.

4. Interchangeability:
                                        The invention is designed to be modular and replaceable, meaning that both the communication module (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) and the microcontroller (Node MCU ESP8266) can be 
                                        swapped for newer technology as it becomes available, without changing the overall system architecture.

                                        The flexibility allows the system to be upgraded without the need to redesign the entire system, making it future-proof.
